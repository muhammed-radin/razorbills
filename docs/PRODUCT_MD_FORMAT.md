# RazorBillz Product Document Format (for AI generators)

This is the canonical format for importing a full product into RazorBillz from a
single text document. Feed it to the **Import product** dialog on the Create New
Product / Edit Product admin pages. Supported files: `.md` / `.txt` (this
format) and `.json` (same shape, raw JSON object).

Rules an AI generator MUST follow:

1. The document starts with a **YAML frontmatter block** (`---` fenced) with one
   `key: value` line per scalar field. Flat scalars only — no nesting.
2. Every field below the frontmatter lives under a `## <Section>` heading.
   Unknown headings are ignored; missing sections are treated as empty.
3. Lists use markdown bullets (`- item`). Tables use the markdown pipe table
   with exactly two columns: `| Label | Value |`.
4. Numbers are plain digits (no currency symbols). Booleans are `true`/`false`.
   `category` must match an existing category **id**.
5. URLs must be absolute (`https://...`). The product is not published from the
   import alone — an admin reviews and presses Create/Save.
6. Media is referenced by URL only. Never inline base64/binary data. Images and
   videos are **not** transcoded during import; link to files that are already
   hosted (Cloudinary, your CDN, …).

| `## Features`             | bullet list                                         | ≥2 bullets, each ≥2 chars |
| `## Tags`                 | bullets or one comma line                           | ≥3 tags                   |
| `## Keywords`             | bullets or one comma line                           | optional                  |
| `## Images`               | bullets, one URL each                               | ≥1 image                  |
| `## Videos`               | bullets, one URL each; optional `URL \| poster-URL` | optional, any number      |

## Validation summary

`id`, `title`, `category`, `brand`, `sku`, `price`, `originalPrice`, `stock`,
`thumbnail`, `description`, plus **3+ tags**, **2+ features** and **1+ image**
are validated (same Zod schema as manual creation). Videos are validated per
item when present (non-empty URL and optional numeric metadata) and are
otherwise optional. The import preview shows every failing field before anything
is written — a document only applies when validation passes.

## Videos (for AI generators)

Videos are optional and are always **referenced by URL**:

- In Markdown, put one absolute URL per bullet under `## Videos`. Add an
  optional poster image after a pipe: `- <video-url> | <poster-url>`.
- In JSON, `videos` is an array. Each entry may be a plain URL string or an
  object with the keys below. Only `url` is required; omitted metadata does not
  invalidate the document. When no poster is given, the admin UI derives one for
  Cloudinary URLs (`/video/upload/so_0/…jpg`).

| Key            | Type   | Required | Notes                                   |
| -------------- | ------ | -------- | --------------------------------------- |
| url            | string | yes      | absolute video URL (`.webm`, `.mp4`, …) |
| poster         | string | no       | absolute image URL for the thumbnail    |
| duration       | number | no       | seconds                                 |
| width / height | number | no       | pixels                                  |
| size           | number | no       | bytes of the hosted file                |

Do **not** invent upload URLs or link to files that do not exist. If you cannot
produce a real hosted video URL, omit `## Videos` / `videos` entirely.

## JSON alternative

The same payload as raw JSON (frontmatter keys + section names as arrays of
strings / `{label, value}` objects) is accepted in a `.json` file. JSON also
accepts `videos` as strings or objects (see above), and `specifications` as
`{label, value}` objects.
